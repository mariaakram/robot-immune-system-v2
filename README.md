# robot-immune-system-v2
This ROS package is the extension of our previous ROS package, robot-immune-system-v1. The package is designed to develop robots that are aware of their internal health through various health indicators and are able to treat their faults by performing required recovery actions. The methodology mimics the behaviour of reactive immune cells, T-cells and B-cells of innate and adaptive immune functions of Biological Immune System.
